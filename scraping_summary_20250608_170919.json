How can we evaluate this in agentic era?\n\nCurious how others are thinking about this.\n\n[[Aditya Raisinghani](/in/adi2412/)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAA4UXUcBAkKixei2NoMXjQwKqt8zi4fm0a4) [[Anoothi Kumar](/in/anoothi/)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAABbb5y0BidnW3WfNfOcLXAmKudw_96h15oQ) [[Anuja Agarwal](/in/anuja-agarwal/)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAACDa7CwB5aLeYjnsENaZ12Tt709LlpnRLtw) [[Malayshree .](/in/malayshree/)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAkDkHMBKSSn4sI1Ae5YbLHAZTax9hjn1Ns) [[Ayush Gupta](/in/ayushgupta19/)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAFwJN0BhM-VNAeML9rNvhhHapqpO3PkHGo) [[Inderpreet Singh](/in/ip2709/)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAI78pcBrLziSzj_vqVZ_gw3lxTfjKJkC90) [[Dayanand K](/in/dayanandk/)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAb50zIB7Eu0yHXw-4IU5RiHH91Zr0jQNgk) [[Sujit Kumar Mishra](/in/arumriaexskm/)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAIFD0oBsA0PBrWplKGRg_L9gy-DMYKIlag) [[Mike Babiy](/in/mike-babiy/)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAjdFD0Bj8p90TrrLHXOLCYYqlqCFclCtJU)\n\n[hashtag\\#AI](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?keywords=%23ai&origin=HASH_TAG_FROM_FEED) [hashtag\\#ProductThinking](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?keywords=%23productthinking&origin=HASH_TAG_FROM_FEED) [hashtag\\#AgenticSystems](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?keywords=%23agenticsystems&origin=HASH_TAG_FROM_FEED) [hashtag\\#LearningProducts](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?keywords=%23learningproducts&origin=HASH_TAG_FROM_FEED)\n\n…more](/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7335364759157972992/)\n\n Activate to view larger image,\n\n ![diagram](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5622AQEKSCy4nciU7w/feedshare-shrink_800/B56ZcxzXgxG0Ag-/0/1748887241664?e=1752105600&v=beta&t=jiygZrq4a_qeV2koqJfsbxWfSvawO9VTsqHYh9-RVwY)\n\n See content credentials\n\n Activate to view larger image,\n\n\t+ ![like](https://static.licdn.com/aero-v1/sc/h/8ekq8gho1ruaf8i7f86vd1ftt)\n\t![love](https://static.licdn.com/aero-v1/sc/h/cpho5fghnpme8epox8rdcds22)\n\t![insightful](https://static.licdn.com/aero-v1/sc/h/lhxmwiwoag9qepsh4nc28zus)\n\n\t18\n\t+ - 4 comments\n\t\t- 2 reposts\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n\n[Show all posts](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sharanjm/recent-activity/all/)\n\nExperienceExperience\n--------------------\n\n * [![lumif.ai logo](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D560BAQHEd1KyI2CaLA/company-logo_100_100/B56Zcae_dUHwAU-/0/1748496021734/lumif_ai_logo?e=1755129600&v=beta&t=ykOe-5OlewO8LnClUNfcC9RYlq8BE-lV9puD7ICvZrs)](https://www.linkedin.com/company/105020821/)\n\n[Co\\-Founder \\& CPOCo\\-Founder \\& CPO\n\nlumif.ai · Full\\-timelumif.ai · Full\\-time\n\n2025 \\- Present · 6 mos2025 to Present · 6 mos\n\nDubai, United Arab Emirates · RemoteDubai, United Arab Emirates · Remote](https://www.linkedin.com/company/105020821/)\n* [![Merry logo](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4D0BAQG3k400bd7GtA/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1656397836752/merry_logo?e=1755129600&v=beta&t=PPgBqqdiMvfPY8K295F7Eum3DuB8ndBzmIQFwhpuj-Y)](https://www.linkedin.com/company/82583664/)\n\n[InvestorInvestor\n\nMerryMerry\n\nFeb 2023 \\- Present · 2 yrs 5 mosFeb 2023 to Present · 2 yrs 5 mos\n\nBengaluru, Karnataka, India · RemoteBengaluru, Karnataka, India · Remote](https://www.linkedin.com/company/82583664/)\n* [![ROSHN l روشن logo](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D0BAQE16WOLMTr60w/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1734508773303/roshnksa_logo?e=1755129600&v=beta&t=Dnotpa26pC17xRV1xRPd1SFboqOK8yN-atVkgcnHY9c)](https://www.linkedin.com/company/30741333/)\n\n[Head of ProductHead of Product\n\nROSHN l روشن · Full\\-timeROSHN l روشن · Full\\-time\n\nFeb 2024 \\- 2025 · 1 yrFeb 2024 to 2025 · 1 yr\n\nOn\\-siteOn\\-site](https://www.linkedin.com/company/30741333/)\n\n\t+ - A PIF Company building 400,000 homes\n\n\t\tAt Roshn, I am instrumental in setting up and scaling the product management function, laying down product management practices, and hiring and mentoring a team of 5 talented Product Managers.

In particular, my work explores how social networks and structures can sometimes work against entrepreneurs in unexpected ways. My current work explores the role of social capital in high\\-tech firms, family businesses, and private equity, exploring how these elements can both help and hinder entrepreneurial success. I employ a mix of econometric and statistical methods, along with lab and field studies, to get to the heart of these issues. My goal is to uncover insights that can help entrepreneurs better navigate the complexities of their social environments and thrive despite the invisible challenges they may face.\n\nIn addition to my research, I teach courses on the strategic management of technology and corporate entrepreneurship. I enjoy bringing real\\-world examples into the classroom and sending my students into organizations within their communities to demonstrate how technology and entrepreneurial thinking can transform businesses.\n\nwww.andrew\\-foley.comI study the hidden social dynamics of entrepreneurship.

It’s clear that the modern workplace simply wasn’t built with women in mind, and frankly, women are tired of being pushed into a broken system and asked to overcome arbitrary and unfair roadblocks to succeed. It's time for that to change.\n\nThese funds, which are part of the $1 billion commitment I announced earlier this year, will be focused on three areas: 1\\) Seeding innovations to build healthy workplaces; 2\\) Informing public policy changes to modernize the workplace; and 3\\) Increasing women’s representation and advancement in AI and tech. It’s essential that women—and all workers—have the support they need at work so they can reach their fullest potential.\n\n…more](/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7272662469708283905/)\n\n[![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E05AQErABq_Ecanvg/feedshare-thumbnail_720_1280/feedshare-thumbnail_720_1280/0/1733937371577?e=1749981600&v=beta&t=l8s_3_B6bDLaLe1UuulCxiuesQ0yA1XoKAg0646J9aM)](/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7273046022254174208/)\n\n\t+ ![like](https://static.licdn.com/aero-v1/sc/h/8ekq8gho1ruaf8i7f86vd1ftt)\n\t![celebrate](https://static.licdn.com/aero-v1/sc/h/b1dl5jk88euc7e9ri50xy5qo8)\n\t![love](https://static.licdn.com/aero-v1/sc/h/cpho5fghnpme8epox8rdcds22)\n\n\t1,247\n\t+ -

As Bill Gates wisely stated, \"The world is changing faster than ever before, and the only way to keep up is to be constantly learning.\"\n\nOver the past 10 weeks, I immersed myself in this transformative course, exploring the intricacies of digital strategies. Guided by [[David Rogers](/in/davidrogersdigital/)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAA0jmkByYuti8D_DTJMCXUykeB1iwdbP8k) and his book 'The Digital Transformation Playbook: Rethink Your Business for the Digital Age', this program offered a creative and seamless learning experience.\n\nDelving into the five domains of digital technologies—customers, competition, data, innovation, and value—this course provided invaluable insights into the challenges and opportunities organisations face. It shed light on the crucial role of leadership and organisational dynamics in driving successful digital strategies and transformation initiatives.\n\nIn the coming weeks, I look forward to sharing some fascinating takeaways and lessons learned from this course. Stay tuned for more insights!\n\n[hashtag\\#digitalstrategy](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?keywords=%23digitalstrategy&origin=HASH_TAG_FROM_FEED) [hashtag\\#digitaltransformation](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?keywords=%23digitaltransformation&origin=HASH_TAG_FROM_FEED) [hashtag\\#digitalbusiness](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?keywords=%23digitalbusiness&origin=HASH_TAG_FROM_FEED)\n\n…more](/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7079624448131108864/)\n\n[Certificate Sid \\- Digital Strategy: ColumbiaBusinessSchool • 1 page\n--------------------------------------------------------------------](/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7079624448131108864/)\n\n[![Certificate Sid -
