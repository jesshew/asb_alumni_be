[Most AI products today feel like horseless carriages \- smart engines bolted onto old software frames. [[Pete Koomen](/in/petekoomen/)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAMJam0BLAhWkES0dsBUP-eXJ0DuWyC6_vE) captures this perfectly.  
  
We keep asking:  
 “How do we add AI to our product?”  
 When the real question is:  
 “What would this product look like if AI had been there from the start?”  
  
That’s the shift: from building features to designing for intelligence.  
  
At [lumif.ai](https://www.linkedin.com/company/lumif-ai/), we’re leaning into this with:  
\-\> Agents that learn and adapt to your workflow  
\-\> Interfaces that learn and adapt from your behavior   
\-\> Agents that reflect your voice, not a one\-size\-fits\-all tone  
  
The best AI products won’t just be smarter.  
They’ll feel like they were meant to be built with AI.  
  
If you’re building AI\-native tools, it’s a must\-read:

[YC General Partner [[Pete Koomen](/in/petekoomen/)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAMJam0BLAhWkES0dsBUP-eXJ0DuWyC6_vE) said most AI products today are like the first automobiles \\\- engines bolted onto horse carriages without rethinking the design.  
  
He calls this the "AI horseless carriage" problem.  
  
Take Gmail's AI as an example. Instead of rebuilding email from the ground up, they added a chatbot to an interface designed 20 years ago.  
  
The result \\\= AI\-generated drafts that don't sound like you, prompts as long as the emails themselves, and more frustration than value.  
  
\*\*The real issue: developers are still treating AI like traditional code\*\*  
  
For decades, there's been a clear division: developers write code, users consume interfaces. AI breaks this model completely.  
  
But most teams are still:  
  
\-\- Hiding AI prompts behind rigid interfaces   
\-\- Controlling every interaction instead of giving users flexibility   
\-\- Building AI features instead of AI\-native products  
  
\*\*What AI\-first actually looks like\*\*  
  
Instead of "how do we add AI to our existing product," the question becomes "how would we build this product if AI existed from day one?"  
  
This means giving users control over system prompts, letting them teach the AI their preferences, and designing workflows that amplify human creativity rather than replacing it.  
  
Koomen says "Almost every tool we've been using for decades can be rethought from the ground up with AI."  
  
The opportunity isn't in making existing software slightly smarter but reimagining what software can be when intelligence is native to the experience.  
  
Most AI products today will look as primitive as those first horseless carriages. The winners will be the ones building actual cars.

[Your A/B test just broke itself.  
  
Most experiments assume your product stays the same.  
But what happens when your product learns and adapts with every interaction?  
  
By Friday, our so\-called “control” has already evolved.  
It’s no longer the same thing we launched on Monday.  
  
As we build agentic systems at [lumif.ai](https://www.linkedin.com/company/lumif-ai/), I’ve been thinking a lot about one question: How do we evaluate something that’s always learning?  
  
What do we track when the product doesn’t just perform, but adapts?  
  
Here are a few signals I’m considering:  
→ Is the system getting better week by week?  
→ How fast does it bounce back from failure?  
→ Are new, unexpected capabilities emerging as it sees more data?  
  
The question shifts from “Which version won?” to:  
“Which system is learning faster over time?”  
  
A/B tests helped us ship better versions.  
But in agentic systems, we should care more about how fast the system learns to make better decisions. How can we evaluate this in agentic era?   
  
Curious how others are thinking about this.

	+ - The project deals with the design of a testable, fault detecting reusable multiplier core based on Vedic mathematics, an ancient Indian system of mathematics that was rediscovered in early twentieth century. This core is an integration of 3 sub modules to perform multiplication, squaring and cubing operation.   
		Ease of evaluation is also built into the core as an integrated self\-testable feature which helps first cut assessment of the core. Fault detection is an added feature of the core to ensure correct operation of the core targeting application debug scenarios of complex SOCs where this core is part of it.

Fortunate enough to have had an opportunity to learn from him.Simply the best and the most complete Engineering Manager I have come across.. !!
		Staying abreast of the latest technology and best practices, ability to motivate and inspire people around him, and able to mentor even fresh college graduates to deliver high\-quality work in a short period of time is an art he has mastered.
		
		He is very humble and always willing to lend a helping hand to anyone in need. Many lessons learned from him \- flexible, open, transparent, and always mentors everyone. Never seen such a leader \- who devotes 100% of his time \& energy to his team and the company. Fortunate enough to have had an opportunity to learn from him.
