üîç Unlocking the Power of Elasticsearch for Company Name Searches! üöÄ

Elasticsearch is powerful yet complex. We realised that it's just hard to get company name searches right üß©
After numerous tweaks and some creative brainstorming, we've finally found a reliable solution.

Check [Peakflo (YC W22\)](https://www.linkedin.com/company/peakflo/) Engineering blog to explore the advanced techniques we used to achieve precise, flexible company name searches. Check it out here: <https://lnkd.in/ecmqNmf6>

Let us know if we can improve it even further. There is always a way to improve things!

[Practical Applications of AI Agents in Finance ü§ñüè¶

I'm excited to release a set of slides that gives an overview of assistant and automation\-based agent architectures and their applications across a broad range of financial verticals \- from investment research to back\-office to compliance/risk management.

In general, there is an increasing range of different agents that range from assistant\-based high HITL to automation\-based runs in background, batch, lower\-HITL. The former helps surface data faster to the user to make better decisions, the latter tends to automate routine knowledge work.

A LOT of financial agent use cases depend heavily on core document processing modules around parsing, extraction, and indexing \- knowledge work is rooted in analyzing and creating PDFs, PowerPoints, Excel.

It took me just 15 minutes to generate a fully functional foreign exchange rate calculator with AI. What's impressive? It uses real\-time FX rates and is secure by design.

‚ö°Ô∏è The Future of Business Software: Generative Web Apps ‚ö°Ô∏è
Traditional B2B SaaS platforms are becoming increasingly bloated as they struggle to accommodate diverse business needs and processes under one solution.

ü¶æ Imagine instead a world where each organization can generate custom SaaS applications tailored precisely to their requirements‚Äîsoftware that's effortlessly adaptable, modifiable, and scalable.

üîê Of course, security and compliance remain critical concerns for AI\-generated applications. Large Language Models have earned a reputation for potentially exposing sensitive information or introducing security vulnerabilities through oversight.

This is why [Peakflo (YC W22\)](https://www.linkedin.com/company/peakflo/) is developing AI platform that prioritize enterprise\-grade security while still harnessing the power of generative AI for business applications.

	+ - I've had the extreme fortune to work with Dmitry in both an academic and professional setting over the past two years and found him to be a deeply technically knowledgeable, action\-oriented pragmatist who leads by example. The quality I most admire about Dmitry, among the many, many talents he possesses, is that he is a constant learner. Whether it be understanding new vulnerabilities in cybersecurity, in vogue product design trends, or current copy\-writing best practices, Dmitry is always learning (and teaching others.)

		As CTO at Alluma, Dmitry built a talented engineering team from the ground up and managed the product development roadmap resulting in the release of a robust, cross\-device exchange in less than 3 months. His ability to empathize with users and prioritize (or formulate) the most impactful product improvements is truly impressive. In the end, you make better decisions with Dmitry on your team.

		He is data\-driven, adaptable, reliable, creative, and focused but above all, he is a genuinely positive person who is a pleasure to be around. I would consider myself truly lucky to work with him again and highly recommend him as a senior technical/product leader.

In this paper, we propose a framework for market research purposes called the Disruptometer. The algorithm uses keywords to provide different types of market insights from data crawling.
		The preliminary algorithm data\-mines information from Twitter and outputs 2 parameters\-Product\-to\-Market Fit and Disruption Quotient, which is obtained from a brand‚Äüs customer value proposition, problem space, and incumbent space. The algorithm has been tested with a venture capitalist portfolio company and market research firm to show high correlated results.
