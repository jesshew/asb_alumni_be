At SAP, we provide end to end solution to 25 industries and help companies gain a competitive advantage and become true digital champions in their industry. Collecting data and leveraging it better to improve your business processes is the essence to stay market relevant these days and we at SAP enable you to exactly do that.

My area of expertise includes B2B sales, prospecting, lead generation, and relationship building. Outside of work, I am into friendly badminton playoffs, some fine wine, and beaches.
