AboutAbout
----------

Passionate about empowering corporations through innovative technology, software and Lean Six Sigma methodologies to reduce waste, streamline operations, and boost productivity. Today, I am a Principal / Business Architecture Manager, North America at Accenture, where I manage workforce management and operational solutions, oversee implementations, and optimize architectural strategies to enhance our clients' Workforce Management systems. Prior to Accenture, I held roles at Macyâ€™s Technology, Ross Stores, Deliverr (acquired by Shopify), Target, Walmart eCommerce, and Morgan Stanley.

I am a dual\-citizen of Brazil and the U.S., trilingual in English, Spanish, and Portuguese. I hold a Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) from Florida State University, an MBA from Asia School of Business in collaboration with MIT Sloan, and a Master of Advanced Management (MAM) from Yale School of Management. Additionally, I completed the first Summer School on Cognitive Robotics at MITâ€™s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) and earned a certificate in Model\-based Systems Engineering from MIT School of Engineering.

I hold certifications as a Lean Six Sigma Black Belt through IASSC, Advanced Certified Scrum Product Owner (A\-CSPO) and Certified Scrum Master (CSM) through Scrum Alliance, as well as a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Digital Cloud Leader through Google. In my free time, I am an Apple iOS developer with three iOS productivity apps that have amassed more than 1,000,000 users globally and play acoustic guitar.Passionate about empowering corporations through innovative technology, software and Lean Six Sigma methodologies to reduce waste, streamline operations, and boost productivity.

Iâ€™m excited to share that I graduated from [Yale School of Management](https://www.linkedin.com/company/yale-school-of-management/)! ðŸŽ“ This incredible journey has been filled with learning, growth, and unforgettable experiences.

Throughout this journey, balancing a demanding, full\-time role at [Macy's Technology](https://www.linkedin.com/company/macy%27s-com/) with my full\-time coursework required immense discipline. I am profoundly grateful for the support from [Macy's](https://www.linkedin.com/company/macy/), and I extend special thanks to my leadersâ€”[[Stuart Stockton](/in/stuartstockton/)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAEKWcIBLkK_-ig8mvJTyz8_g7XxKBjiX4U), [[PJ Singh](/in/pjsinghnyc/)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAFp1w8BnEbGXvYrWrCCr1QBkUMSkqcNngg), [[Ram Chenchu](/in/ramchenchu/)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAArkHYBNXZdXZGN_jHpZYwUM8BsL8DASfM) and [[Daniel Peck](/in/daniel-peck-62b0b36/)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAEU8sMBjQHMOHezM2dM_oGufAgSm4Pu9DM) for their encouragement and flexibility.

I am deeply thankful to all the amazing people I've met along the wayâ€”your support and camaraderie have made this journey truly special.

A heartfelt thanks to my family and friends for their unwavering support and encouragement throughout this journey. I couldn't have done it without you!

Looking forward to the next chapter and new adventures ahead!

Seeing team members living our Target purpose is such an inspiration, and I'm happy to have visited some of our Central Florida Target locations this week with several field leaders, as [[Sam Schiller, MBA](/in/sam-schiller-mba-75b8166/)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAEwPbcBPU_kpYrZ7iKbQGBIW3exWRZ8SyY), [[Ricky Whittaker](/in/ricky-whittaker-13010b49/)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAopJvQBNDUQY9ncIS9-jqpimQ_DTzrfWh0) \& [[Patel Singh, MBA](/in/patel-singh-mba-4a5903111/)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAABwTkv0BSfs5I20KYXFDX0I6pbEnW0p3e3U).

We had a chance to review \& test our new system\-generated order application that has been recently deployed to specific food \& beverage categories across all of our stores.

Packed with new, automated, replenishment capabilities and features, this is definitely a game\-changer digital solution that will enable all of our food \& beverage associates to manage replenishment in a more efficient way, to better serve our guests. It's exciting to be part of an organization that strives not only to be great but best\-in\-class.

A big thank you to everyone at stores T\-1790 \& T\-1966 for hosting us and showing us what you do best: Helping all families discover the joy of everyday life. I canâ€™t wait to see more stores \& meet more of our team members across the United States.

Congratulations to the entire [Target](https://www.linkedin.com/company/target/) team for a job well done. Your dedication, teamwork, and passion is what makes the difference!

[[Accenture](https://www.linkedin.com/company/accenture/) recently introducedÂ Trusted Agent Huddleâ„¢, a first\-of\-its\-kind capability that enables seamless, secure collaboration among multiple AI agents across different enterprise systems. As part of our AI Refineryâ„¢ platform, it's already transforming how marketing teams work: accelerating content workflows, optimizing media performance, and amplifying campaign impact. This breakthrough isnâ€™t just about smarter systems â€” itâ€™s a new way of creating and collaborating across the organization at scale.

Every day, I become more excited about the limitless possibilities that AI enables for our people and our clientsâ€”and Trusted Agent Huddle is a bold step toward that future.

		Ï– Analyzed the full process of composite manufacturing for sub\-assemblies with a team of 5 under the head of engineering at ACM
		Ï– Recognized organizational and systematic problem in the estimation of hours and material consumption, it was very manual across 7 commercial data library workbooks in Excel, which caused significant lead time in updating and referencing sheets

For the duration of the contract, nothing could be altered.
		Ï– In response, we built an automated entry form for quotes that is easy and repeatable to more accurately estimate quotes on hours for jobs, using VBA we designed the front end template with all the decision variables linked to the backend master database, which referenced ACMâ€™s historic data on hours in each process to output more accurate estimates, which cut lead time by 40%\+Our project was based on enhancing the cost estimation process at the request for quotation (RFQ) stage by both reducing lead time and improving accuracy for quotes to better assess risk and mitigate losses on bids for client contract projects
