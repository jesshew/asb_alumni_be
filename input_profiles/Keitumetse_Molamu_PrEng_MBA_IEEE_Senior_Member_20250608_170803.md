AboutAbout
----------

Over the past 15\+ yrs, my engineering experience has focused mainly on automation, control \& instrumentation as well as lighting and small power. I have worked in various industries from telecommunications to satellite technology and construction. My IT background has allowed me to apply computer and information science in support of my engineering technical skills.
My progression to Engineering management has developed my love for operations and technology management which is now supplemented by my MBA qualification.

I am keen to apply skills in roles that focus on operations, technology management and engineering project management. I believe technology and innovation are crucial in building a collaborative and inclusive world. I see my value in helping to create that world. Let's get started!

Specific engineering work experience
â€¢ Design, specification, Installation supervision, commissioning of control and instrumentation equipment and systems. Control panel design, cable specification and electrification. Including, logic design, software programming, analytics (incl. machine learning)

â€¢ Design, specification, Installation supervision, commissioning of power and lighting systems. Including, Exit and emergency lighting, Lightning Protection, Distribution board design and cabling

â€¢ General project management and 3rd party partner (contractors) selection, management and quality control for large and small\-scale industrial projects (new build, repair and upgrade projects).Over the past 15\+ yrs, my engineering experience has focused mainly on automation, control \& instrumentation as well as lighting and small power.
