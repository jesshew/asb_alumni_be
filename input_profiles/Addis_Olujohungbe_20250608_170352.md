This makes him an all\-around problem solver. He is proactive and innovative in his problem\-solving approach, putting great effort in a follow\-through. Not only are his accolades impressive, but he is even more impressive in person, especially in brainstorming or direct/indirect mentoring sessions. I would recommend him to be at the helm of championing change in any organization, especially one seeking versatile management and improvement expertise.Jason is a very knowledgeable, yet a down\-to\-earth leader.
