[Thrilled to announce my completion of [Columbia Business School Executive Education](https://www.linkedin.com/company/columbia-business-school-executive-education/) and [Emeritus](https://www.linkedin.com/company/emeritused/)’ “Digital Strategies for Business” course.

In a rapidly evolving business landscape, digital transformation is no longer a luxury but a necessity. As Bill Gates wisely stated, "The world is changing faster than ever before, and the only way to keep up is to be constantly learning."

Over the past 10 weeks, I immersed myself in this transformative course, exploring the intricacies of digital strategies. Guided by [[David Rogers](/in/davidrogersdigital/)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAA0jmkByYuti8D_DTJMCXUykeB1iwdbP8k) and his book 'The Digital Transformation Playbook: Rethink Your Business for the Digital Age', this program offered a creative and seamless learning experience.

Delving into the five domains of digital technologies—customers, competition, data, innovation, and value—this course provided invaluable insights into the challenges and opportunities organisations face. It shed light on the crucial role of leadership and organisational dynamics in driving successful digital strategies and transformation initiatives.

In the coming weeks, I look forward to sharing some fascinating takeaways and lessons learned from this course. Stay tuned for more insights!
