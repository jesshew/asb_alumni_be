His ability to clearly present himself in the English medium to the professors and business associates in the financial industry was proven in his success to secure a placement project with RBS while completing his dissertation in Edinburgh.

		The attentiveness to detail, flexibility, leadership skills and his teamwork as reflected in all individual assignments and group projects are a few indispensable skill sets that will serve him well in the corporate world.
