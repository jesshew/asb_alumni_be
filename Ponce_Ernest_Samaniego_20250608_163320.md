AboutAbout
----------

I’m a senior product leader specializing in sustainability, circular economy, and impact\-driven technology. Over the past decade, I’ve built and launched 80\+ products and programs across 22 countries, leading teams of up to 20 across Amazon, the United Nations, and the Asian Development Bank. My expertise lies in scaling complex solutions that bridge operational excellence with measurable environmental and social outcomes.

At Amazon, I led recycling initiatives across global logistics, applying data, AI, and product thinking to reduce environmental footprint and ensure compliance at scale. My cross\-sector experience enables me to translate ESG goals into actionable roadmaps, having operated at the intersection of corporate innovation, public policy, and nonprofit impact.

I hold a Master of Science in Management Studies from MIT Sloan through an ASEAN Fellow scholarship, and an MBA from the Asia School of Business, where I earned the President’s Leadership Award and Best Action Learning Project honors.I’m a senior product leader specializing in sustainability, circular economy, and impact\-driven technology.
